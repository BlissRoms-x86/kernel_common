Description:	(R) The status of a dvc-trace source device with
		respect to an USB function driver.
		  Free - The device is free
		  Reserved - The device is reserved by an USB
			function but not in use.
		  In use - The device is used by an USB function.

KernelVersion:	4.0
Contact:	Traian Schiau <traianx.schiau@intel.com>
Description:	(RW) The protocol id of a dvc-trace source device,
		this will used in function driver interface
		descriptors (u8). According to USB debug class
		specification the protocol id is vendor specific.

Date:		May 2015
KernelVersion:	4.0
Contact:	Traian Schiau <traianx.schiau@intel.com>
Description:	(RW) Hex-dump of the descriptors provided by the
		source device.
		eg. A debug class output connection descriptor
		09 24 02 04 03 00 00 00 00
		ll tt ss xx xx xx xx xx ii
		 |  |  |                 +- iConnection string id.
		 |  |  +- Descriptor sub-type DC_OUTPUT_CONNECTION
		 |  +- Descriptor type (USB_DT_CS_INTERFACE)
		 +- Descriptor length
		Writing:
		  - is not allowed while the device is Reserved or In Use.
		  - will replace all the descriptors currently present.
		  - will remove any strings previously provided.
		  - should use the same format.
		  - accepts multiple descriptors separated by space or '\n'.

What:		/sys/bus/dvctrace/devices/<device>/strings
Date:		May 2015
KernelVersion:	4.0
Contact:	Traian Schiau <traianx.schiau@intel.com>
Description:	(RW) Currently set usb descriptor strings in
		<descriptor_index>.<offset>: string format.
		<descriptor_index>.<offset> identifies the location where
		the string id is needed.
		eg. Having the same debug class output connection descriptor,
		as the first descriptor.
		09 24 02 04 03 00 00 00 00
		ll tt ss xx xx xx xx xx ii
		                         +- iConnection string id.
		0.8: My output connection - will identify the string associated
		with this descriptor.
		Writing:
		  - is not allowed while the device is Reserved or In Use.
		  - will replace all the strings currently present.
		  - should use the same format.
		  - accepts multiple strings separated by ";" or '\n'.
		    eg. "0.4: first string; 1.4: second string"
