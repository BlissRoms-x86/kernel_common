Subject: [PATCH 4/6] UBUNTU: SAUCE: (no-up) disable -pie when gcc has it
 enabled by default

In Ubuntu 16.10, gcc's defaults have been set to build Position
Independent Executables (PIE) on amd64 and ppc64le (gcc was configured
this way for s390x in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS). This breaks the kernel build on
amd64. The following patch disables pie for x86 builds (though not yet
verified to work with gcc configured to build PIE by default i386 --
we're not planning to enable it for that architecture).

The intent is for this patch to go upstream after expanding it to
additional architectures where needed, but I wanted to ensure that
we could build 16.10 kernels first. I've successfully built kernels
and booted them with this patch applied using the 16.10 compiler.

Patch is against yakkety.git, but also applies with minor movement
(no fuzz) against current linus.git.
