 * HACK for -rev3 to bump up voltage
 *
 * There's some extra voltage drop on early revs of kevin due to board layout
 * problems.  On -rev3 we're almost there, so only 50 mV (it was 200 mV on
 * earlier revs)
 *
 * NOTE: The 'regulator-microvolt-offset' is not a terribly well-tested and
 * has some quirks (like I think it doesn't necessarily validate constraints
 * properly?), but seems to work and seems better than hardcoding every
 * operating point everywhere.
