	depends on I2C
	help
	  ADG792A and ADG792G Wide Bandwidth Triple 4:1 Multiplexers

	  The driver supports both operating the three multiplexers in
	  parallel and operating them independently.

	  To compile the driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called mux-adg792a.

config MUX_GPIO
	tristate "GPIO-controlled Multiplexer"
	depends on GPIOLIB || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  GPIO-controlled Multiplexer controller.

	  The driver builds a single multiplexer controller using a number
	  of gpio pins. For N pins, there will be 2^N possible multiplexer
	  states. The GPIO pins can be connected (by the hardware) to several
	  multiplexers, which in that case will be operated in parallel.

	  To compile the driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called mux-gpio.

config MUX_CHT_USB_MUX
	tristate "Intel Cherrytrail USB Multiplexer"
	depends on ACPI && X86 && EXTCON
	help
	  This driver adds support for the internal USB mux for muxing the OTG
	  USB data lines between the xHCI host controller and the dwc3 gadget
	  controller found on Intel Cherrytrail SoCs.

	  To compile the driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called mux-intel_cht_usb_mux.

config MUX_MMIO
	tristate "MMIO register bitfield-controlled Multiplexer"
	depends on (OF && MFD_SYSCON) || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  MMIO register bitfield-controlled Multiplexer controller.

	  The driver builds multiplexer controllers for bitfields in a syscon
	  register. For N bit wide bitfields, there will be 2^N possible
	  multiplexer states.

	  To compile the driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called mux-mmio.

config MUX_PI3USB30532
	tristate "Pericom PI3USB30532 Type-C cross switch driver"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  This driver adds support for the Pericom PI3USB30532 Type-C cross
	  switch / mux chip found on some devices with a Type-C port.

	  To compile the driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called mux-pi3usb30532.
